# partychurch
A web-based livestreaming site accompanied by ephemeral chat that lets viewers
send simple, short messages along with a 2-second video of themselves.

The offical server can be found at [https://chat.meatspac.es](https://chat.meatspac.es)

## Features
- Send a message to anyone connected to the same partychurch server
- Provides jpeg (filmstrip-style) videos alongside chats, which tend to be
more efficient to display than videos used in meatspace-chat-v2 (h264
videos are provided for legacy clients)
- No signup required, but users receive a unique ID on first visit (displayed
to users as an identicon alongside messages).
- Allows for muting users based on their ID, removing all their current
messages and blocking any future ones
- Performs extremely minimal DOM element creation and recycles message
elements, meaning the page loads quickly and is quite stable over long
periods of time.

## Running a server
### Required software
partychurch requires [node](http://nodejs.org) >=6.0.0, ffmpeg/libav, and ImageMagick
in order to work. Node can be downloaded from the official site. ffmpeg or libav
can generally be installed from your OS's package manager, or from source. Examples
of installing it:

**OSX**
```bash
$ brew install ffmpeg --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-libass --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openjpeg --with-opus --with-theora --with-tools
```

**Ubuntu/Debian**
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick with IM compatibility) is also required, and is also generally
available from your OS's package manager, e.g.:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

### Configuring your server
Server configuration is handled through a JSON file: `conf.json`.

`conf.json-example` in the main directory will often provide all you need
for a development server, so for most developers, you can simply do:
```bash
$ cp conf.json-example conf.json
```

This will set you up with a server running on port `3456` over HTTP.

The server can then be run with:
```bash
$ npm start
```

If you are running a production partychurch server, or simply want to
customize your development environment, you can change a few options in
`conf.json`. The options are:

### Normal options
#### port
The port to run the HTTP server on for this instance.

**Ex:** `"port": 3000`

#### idKey
The key to use for hashing user ID's. This allows users to be given a
stable, unique ID per browser, but not expose their actual fingerprint
to other users on the server or be able to track users across partychurch
instances. This value should be unique to the server you're running it
on and sufficiently long (10+ characters recommended).

**Ex:** `"idKey": "thisServerIsGreat123"`

#### gaTrackingId
The tracking ID to use for Google Analytics tracking. If this isn't
specified (or is a falsy value), Analytics will not be utilized.

**Ex:** `"gaTrackingId": "UA-9999999-1"`

### HTTPS options (all must be specified if you want to use HTTPS)
#### sslCert
A relative filepath to an SSL certificate file to be used for setting up
HTTPS connections.

**Ex:** `"sslCert": "./certs/certificate.crt"`

#### sslKey
A relative filepath to the private key used for the SSL certificate file specified in `sslCert`.

**Ex:** `"sslKey": "./certs/private.key"`

#### sslCaBundle
A relative filepath to the bundle of CA certificates to be used with the SSL certificate specified
in `sslCert`. These should be provided by your certificate provider.

**Ex:** `"sslCaBundle": "./certs/partychurch.ca-bundle"`

#### sslPort
The port HTTPS connections should be accepted on.

**Ex:** `"sslPort": 443`

#### canonicalHost
The host non-HTTPS connections should be redirected to (the host of your HTTPS site).

**Ex:** `"canonicalHost": "https://seat.camp"`

## Protocol
The protocol of partychurch is built around socket.io, making use of binary frames where appropriate.

### Connecting
Upon connecting, clients must send a fingerprint to the server. This fingerprint should uniquely
identify a particular client, and be relatively stable. Examples of good choices for this would be
a hardware identifier (e.g. Android ID), or a fingerprint constructed from many data points that
don't change often (e.g. fingerprintjs). Bad choices are things like IP addresses, since these could
potentially change a lot, as well as collide for multiple users.

To send the fingerprint, clients simply emit a `fingerprint` message with the fingerprint data as
the body, i.e.
```javascript
io.emit('fingerprint', 'myCoolFingerprint')
```

The server will reply with a `userid` message containing the ID it has calculated for this client,
which should be saved so that a client can recognize which messages are its own. This ID will be
constant for the lifetime of the websocket connection. An example of handling the message would be:
```javascript
io.on('userid', function(userId) {
  myId = userId
})
```

Clients should then specify what type of video they would like to receive by joining a channel. They
may do this using the `join` message:

```javascript
io.emit('join', 'jpg')
```

At present, the server supports two video types: `jpg` (vertically-stacked JPEG filmstrip) or
`h264`.

### Messages
Messages are transmitted to clients using the `chat` message. The format of the data passed in this
message is:
```javascript
{
  "video": ArrayBuffer(),
  "videoType": "jpg",
  "videoMime": "image/jpeg",
  "key": "AUniqueIdForTheMessage",
  "text": "The text the user sent",
  "sent": 1421135370231,
  "userId": "TheUserIDOftheSender",
  "from": "partychurch"
}
```

`videoType` and `videoMime` will change based on what video format you subscribed to. `sent` is a
unix timestamp corresponding to when the message was originally sent. `from` specifies what server
the message originated from (and can currently only be `partychurch`).

Clients can send messages by sending a `chat` message themselves, with the first parameter in the
following format:
```json
{
  "text": "The text the user wants to send",
  "format": "image/jpeg",
  "ack": "AUniqueIdTheServerShouldAckWith"
}
```
Clients should send an array of 10 frames (as binary) as the second parameter, e.g.
```javascript
io.emit('chat', message, frames)
```

`format` specifies what format these frames are in. At present, only `image/jpeg` is accepted. If
`ack` is specified, the server will send a response message containing the ID given, allowing
clients to find out if specific messages succeeded or failed. Acks are transmitted via an `ack`
message, formatted as:
```json
{
  "key": "AckIdThatWasSpecified",
  "err": "An error message (if applicable)"
}
```
If `err` is not set, the message sending succeeded.

### Status updates
The server will send clients a number of different status updates to allow things like user counts
to be known. These are all handled through seperate messages, which are:

#### active
Specifies how many users are currently connected.
```javascript
io.on('active', function(numActive) {
  alert('There are ' + numActive + ' active partychurch users!')
})
```

## Contributing
partychurch is written using ES6-compliant JavaScript, compiled to ES5 using babel. Client-side code
is similarly written, but compiled with `browserify` and `babelify`. Contributions should attempt to
make use of ES6 features where they make sense. Pull requests are accepted and will be looked at in
a timely manner. If you are contributing a new feature (rather than a bug fix), its a good idea to
open a PR early to discuss the viability of that feature in the larger ecosystem before you attempt
to write code for it.

New features will be accepted if they fortify/enhance behavior that developed from the community
(e.g. hashtags on Twitter), but will likely be denied if they are something completely outside of
the way the community uses the site.
